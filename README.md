How to Play The Game
---
WHAT?LE is everything that Wordle is, but the opposite! 

**_Here you guess non-existent words that sound like they could be words!_**   
Did you know that 'STOIT' isn't a word? Well, in WHAT?LE it is.

Instructions
---
The gameplay works exactly like Wordle except for one little detail: **You may use any combination of letters and any word to fill the squares!**  
This means you have to be careful which letters you choose because the computer won't stop you from submitting anything! Simple! But also kinda hard!

 - When you find a letter in the exact same spot as the word, the box will turn green! ðŸŸ©
 
 - When you find a letter in a different spot, the box will turn yellow! ðŸŸ¨

- If the letter doesn't exist in the word then the box will turn gray!

Outcomes
---
When you guess the word, you win!  
At the end you get to create a definition for the word and save it in your dictionary.

Don't forget to click the share button to copy your word to the clipboard so you can share it with your friends.

This is the first project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Flex Immersive Class of 2022.  

Technologies used are **HTML, CSS and Javascript**. 

One of the main goals while building this app was making a Javascript file that had a clear separation of concerns. That means that I tried to make sure that the functions were as re-useable as possible and dependecies to other functions were minimized.

Saved defintions and stats are saved and updated in local storage so that when the user revisits the game the data will persist.

No Wordle tutorials were viewed during the making of this game.
