# What?le
## That's not a word!

WHAT?LE is everything that Wordle is, but the opposite! Here you guess non-existent words that sound like they could be words! Did you know that 'STOIT' isn't a word? Well, in WHAT?LE it is

## Instructions
The gameplay works exactly like Wordle! You use existing words to guess a word that doesn't exist! Simple! I think?

When you find a letter in the exact same spot as the word, the box will turn green!

When you find a letter in a different spot, the box will turn yellow!

If the letter doesn't exist in the word then the box will turn gray!

## Outcomes

When you guess the word, you win! At the end you get to create a definition for the word and save it in your dictionary.
